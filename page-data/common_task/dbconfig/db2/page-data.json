A common page size makes database administration easier and improves performance. For example, indexes of tables in the 32 K page table space that use 4 K pages require less I/O.\n* Move all LOBs to the 4 K page LOBs table space.\n* Move all tables that do not need 32 K page to the 4 K page data table space. It can improve buffer pool utilization and decrease database I/O.\n* Enable compression on tables if it is wanted. Compression was tested by Cúram with no issues.\n* Review the use of dedicated table spaces. Consider moving the largest tables (for example, `DYNAMICEVIDENCEDATAATTRIBUTE` and `DEPENDENCY`) to dedicated table spaces.

From experience, with good I/O layouts, the only reason for partitioning is maintenance (similar to dedicated table spaces).\n* After creating the database, see **Configuring the IBM® Db2® database** in the **Development Environment Installation Guide**, consider setting the `highmem` buffer pool size to `AUTOMATIC` e.g.,\n\n ```sql\n  db2 alter bufferpool HIGHMEM size AUTOMATIC\n ```\n\n  see [ALTER BUFFERPOOL](https://www.ibm.com/support/producthub/db2/docs/content/SSEPGG_11.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0000885.html)\n\n <InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n  **Note:** The above will cause the Ant `configtest` target to fail, see **Testing the configuration** in the **Development Environment Installation Guide**.
