This guide provides a quick-start and guidelines to tuning IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) in a production or production-like environment in both traditional SPM deployments (VMs or bare-metal) and Kubernetes environments.
Learn about the key tuning parameters for a system deployment of SPM, including formulas to use for some parameters and starter values for others.

> The configurable parameters and tuning values listed are for guidance purposes only. These configurable parameters and values are a suggested starting point and are not definitive. Clients should perform their own testing to validate and verify their own settings, in order to meet their system needs.

> While the starter configurable parameters and values are based on experience and are sensible for production, it is unlikely they are the configuration for your specific system. **Therefore, it is strongly recommended these configurations are further tuned during your load testing and production monitoring.**

## How to use this guide

First, carry out the tasks in **Common Tuning Tasks**, then depending on your deployment type carry out the tasks in either **Tuning On VMs** or **Tuning on Kubernetes**.

## What are Common Tuning Tasks?

In the section **Common Tuning Tasks**, all recommendations are applicable to any SPM deployment irrespective of deployment on traditional infrastructure (VM/bare metal) or Kubernetes.

## Scope

The following performance tuning tasks are outside the scope of this guide:

* Operating system tuning
* Network tuning
* Disk subsystem tuning

Please note as a complex software product actual results may vary, based on a broad range of implementation specific factors, such as Cúram modifications and customization, transaction mix, hardware platform, third party software and database size.
