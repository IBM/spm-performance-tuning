## Overview

The following information describes how to tune the resources of the MQ pods for each Cúram application (for example, `curam`, `rest`, etc.).

As independent from each other, the Cúram applications generally require flexibility in specifying tuning settings which is achieved with the `global.apps.config.<applicationID>.mqTuning` values.

For additional information about MQ performance, tuning and sizing please refer to [MQ Performance documents](http://ibm-messaging.github.io/mqperf/).

## Pod requests and limits

The MQ pod `cpu` and `memory` resource requests and limits can be specified by setting `cpu`: and `memory`: values for the `global.apps.config.<applicationID>.mqTuning.resources.requests` and `global.apps.config.<applicationID>.mqTuning.resources.limits` keys,
which is replaced by the lower-case EAR file basename.

For example, the following configuration illustrates how to set the MQ pods of the `curam` application to have resources requests for the `cpu` of 1 and a `memory` of 1024Mi, and resources limits for the `cpu` of 1 and a `memory` of 1024Mi,
while setting the MQ pods of the `rest` application to have resources requests for the `cpu` of 1 and a `memory` of 1024Mi, and resources limits for the `cpu` of 1 and a `memory` of 1024Mi:

```yaml
# Resource limits for the MQ pods of the Curam and Rest application
global:
  apps:
    config:
      curam:
        mqTuning:
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 1
              memory: 1024Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 1
              memory: 1024Mi
        ...
      rest:
        mqTuning:
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 1
              memory: 1024Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 1
              memory: 1024Mi
        ...
```

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

For the Guaranteed QoS, Cúram highly recommends that a pod must have **both** CPU and Memory requests and limits set to equal values. If requests & limits are different for a given pod, it would be eligible for rescheduling in case of resource pressure on its node.

For more information please review [Configure Quality of Service for Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#create-a-pod-that-gets-assigned-a-qos-class-of-guaranteed).
