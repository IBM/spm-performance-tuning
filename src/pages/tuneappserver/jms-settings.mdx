The application server settings for Java Message Service (JMS), which include connection factory and activation specification settings,
can affect performance. You must tune both the connection factory settings and the activation specification settings.

The client of a connection factory is the application. The application uses the connection factory to push or pull messages
to or from the messaging engine through a queue. The client of an activation specification is the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) container.
The EJB container obtains an activation specification to register a `MessageEndpointFactory` for the message driven bean (MDB) with a ResourceAdapter.

When a client pushes a message to the messaging engine, the messaging engine uses the registered `MessageEndpointFactory`
to forward the message to the application, for example, the MDB. Then, the application asynchronously receives messages,
rather than requiring the client to poll or block by trying to pull a message from the queue.

## Connection factory: jms/CuramConnectionQueueFactory

Similar to the `jdbc/curamsibdb` data source, size the connection pool for the `jms/CuramConnectionQueueFactory`
connection factory by using the following formula:

<br/>
<strong>WebSphere</strong>

```
max_connections = WebContainer_max_threads + SIBJMSRAThreadPool_max_threads + 1
```

<br/>
<strong>WebLogic</strong>

```
max_connections = default_max_thread_constraint + MDBWorkManager_Max_thread_constraint +1
```

To prevent the processing cost of pool growth and shrinkage, it is suggested to set `min_connections = max_connections`.

## WebSphere - activation specifications

Tune the maximum concurrent end points for the JMS activation specifications for the Cúram queues. The settings define
how many EJB MDBs are available to process JMS messages. Asynchronous processing concurrency in the application server
is limited by the lower of the number of either `MDBs` or `SIBJMSRAThreadPool` threads.

Set the maximum concurrent end points for the Cúram error queues to 1. This setting is suggested because errors are not expected at high volume.

This sizing applies to the following activation specifications:

* `DPError`
* `WorkflowError`
* `CuramDeadMessageQueue`

Then, for simplicity, use the following formulas to set the maximum concurrent end points for the three main Cúram queues:

```
max_end_points_DPEnactment = SIBJMSRAThreadPool_max_threads
max_end_points_WorkflowEnactment = SIBJMSRAThreadPool_max_threads
max_end_points_WorkflowActivity = SIBJMSRAThreadPool_max_threads
```

The previous formulas effectively simplify tuning for asynchronous processing by creating a single point for tuning,
which is the number of JMS threads. However, if more granular tuning is required, you can decrease the concurrent end points,
for either Cúram Deferred Processing or Workflow.

## WebLogic - message driven beans

In WebLogic, the number of EJB MDBs is set in the `-ejb-jar.xml` deployment descriptor. The descriptor also associates
MDBs with the MDBWorkManager, as shown in the following example:

```
<weblogic-enterprise-bean>
    ...
    <message-driven-descriptor>
    <pool>
        <max-beans-in-free-pool>3</max-beans-in-free-pool>
        <initial-beans-in-free-pool>3</initial-beans-in-free-pool>
    </pool>
    </message-driven-descriptor>
    ...
    <dispatch-policy>MDBWorkManager</dispatch-policy>
</weblogic-enterprise-bean>

```

Set both the maximum and initial values of the beans in the free pool for the Cúram error MDBs to 1. This setting is suggested
because errors are not expected at high volume, and it applies to the `DPErrorMDB` and `WorkflowErrorMDB` beans.

Then, for simplicity, use the following formulas to set both the maximum and initial values of the beans in the free pool for the three main Cúram MDBs:

```
beans_in_free_pool_DPEnactmentMDB=MDBWorkManager_max_thread_constraint
beans_in_free_pool_WorkflowEnactmentMDB=MDBWorkManager_max_thread_constraint
beans_in_free_pool_WorkflowActivityMDB=MDBWorkManager_max_thread_constraint

```

The previous formulas effectively simplify tuning for asynchronous processing by creating a single point for tuning,
which is the number of JMS threads. However, if more granular tuning is required, you can decrease the beans in the free pool,
for either Cúram Deferred Processing or Workflow.
