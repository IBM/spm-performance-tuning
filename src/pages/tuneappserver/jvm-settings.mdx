Because of the memory requirements in Social Program Management, either a 64-bit WebSphereÂ® Application
Server (WAS) or WebLogic Server (WLS) application server is required for production.

For the SPM internal application and the portals that are deployed in their own cluster, start with the following settings:

```
minimum heap size = maximum heap size = 4GB
```

<br/>
<strong>HotSpot JVM</strong>

* Size the Permanent Generation to at least 512 MB
* Set the Nursery size to about two-thirds of the Heap size

<br/>
<strong>GSS and BirtViewer</strong>

* Start with `Minimum Heap Size = Maximum Heap Size = 1GB`

<br/>

Then, use the following heuristic to further tune heap sizes during your load tests, with an objective of
getting above 98% garbage collection efficiency. Configure the following settings, where `avg_used_after_global`
is the average amount of used heap after global collections:

```
-Xmx = 8 * avg_used_after_global
-Xms = 8 * avg_used_after_global
-Xmn = 6 * avg_used_after_global
```

The following common recommendations outline the rationale behind the previous heuristic:

* A recommendation for sizing the tenured generation is to have a free tenured utilization after global collection of around 50%.The tenure contains global and thread-scoped SPM caches, and any long-lived objects.
* A recommendation for sizing the nursery generation is to have a nursery as large as possible, if the pause times are acceptable. The nursery contains transient objects for in-flight SPM transactions, so its sizing depends on the number of
concurrent transactions and the average memory payload of a transaction. The goal is to minimize the number of transient objects that survive collections and end up in the tenure. We have found in our load tests that a 3:1 ratio of nursery to tenure gives good results.
