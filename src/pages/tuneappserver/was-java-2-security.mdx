The recommendation is to turn off Java 2 security because Cúram does not use it.
The WebSphere® Application Server (WAS) Java 2 security feature has a performance cost when it is turned on.

In WAS, when Java™ 2 security is turned on, every time Java code calls the classloader to load a class or a resource and so on,
the call goes through a synchronized block, then a security check, and potentially an access to the file system and then another security check.
Effectively, the impact is twofold:

* Performance degrades badly in low memory situations, as weak reference caches like ResourceBundles are constantly cleared and reloaded. Each reload means a call to the classloader, and hence going through a Java lock, security checks, and a file system access.
* Even in a normal memory situation, it is a bottleneck because Java code that is calling the classloader goes through the lock and security checks.
