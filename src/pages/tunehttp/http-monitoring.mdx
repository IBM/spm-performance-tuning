To monitor the HTTP server, modify the `httpd.conf` file as shown in the example.

If you are using secure access to `server-status`, see the relevant HTTP server documentation.

```shell
LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so
<Location /server-status
SetHandler server-status
 Order allow,deny
 Allow from all
</Location>
```

To gather extended status information, ensure that the following section is not commented out in the httpd.conf file:

```shell
<IfModule mod_status.c>
 ExtendedStatus On
</IfModule>
```

Restart the web server and open the following URL in your browser:

```shell
http://<web_server_host>/server-status
```

In the server-status page, you can view the number of threads and their state.
