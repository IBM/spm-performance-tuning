Use these guidelines to tune the HTTP server. The HTTP server typically hosts Social Program Management
(SPM) static content, and web applications that are built by using assets such as the IBM® Universal Access
Responsive Web Application or the IBM Social Program Management Design System.

## Static Content

An application server is optimized to serve dynamic content, while an HTTP server is optimized to serve static content.
Package the IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) static content and copy it to the HTTP Server.

To enable static content in SPM, set the `STATIC_CONTENT_SERVER` element in the curam-config.xml file and do a full SPM build.
