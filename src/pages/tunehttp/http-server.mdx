Use these guidelines to tune the HTTP server. The HTTP server typically hosts Cúram static content, and web applications that are built by using assets such as the Cúram Universal Access
Responsive Web Application or the Cúram Design System.

## Static Content

An application server is optimized to serve dynamic content, while an HTTP server is optimized to serve static content.
Package the Cúram static content and copy it to the HTTP Server.

To enable static content in Cúram, set the `STATIC_CONTENT_SERVER` element in the curam-config.xml file and do a full Cúram build.
