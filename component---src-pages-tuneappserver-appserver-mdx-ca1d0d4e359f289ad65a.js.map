Refine the values during load testing of the system and\nduring monitoring of production. A load test phase in the project is highly recommended.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Number of application servers`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Determine the number of application servers in your application clusters that are based on availability requirements.\nAn initial starting point is to have at least two application servers per cluster. However, it is recommended\nto use three or more application servers per cluster to ensure good performance and quality of service in case of server failure.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Another consideration for the number of application servers is the number of cores that are available from the operating\nsystem. In general, it is recommended to keep the number of threads in a Cúram application server\nto a low multiplier of the number of cores, as described in the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/curam-performance-tuning/tuneappserver/thread-pools\"\n      }}>{`Thread pools`}</a>{` section. However,\na high number of cores can result in a very high number of threads and, therefore, a higher probability of threads\ncontending on Java locks. In that case, it is advisable to split the threads across multiple application servers\ninstead of just one, which reduces the probability of contention. However, a drawback of this approach is increased\nmemory utilization on the operating system as multiple JVMs are needed.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXLayout","DefaultLayout","MDXContent","_ref","components","props","_objectWithoutProperties","_excluded","mdx","Object","assign","mdxType","parentName","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
